     abstract = {A theory for the flow and non-linear diffusion effects in mixtures of fluids is formulated based upon hydrodynamical considerations. It is assumed that each point of the mixture is occupied simultaneously by all constituents in given portions. The motion of each constituent is governed by the usual equations of motion and continuity. The mechanical properties of each component are specified by means of constitutive equations for the stresses; diffusion effects are accounted for by means of a body force acting on each constituent which depends upon the composition and relative motion of the substances in the mixture. The theory is extended to deal with the diffusion of a mixture of fluids through a rigid solid. The theory is applied to a number of steady-state problems involving non-Newtonian fluids including the diffusion of a fluid through a rigid plate, the laminar flow of a mixture and the flow of a mixture between rotating cylinders. The propagation of plane waves through a homogeneous mixture of viscous fluids at rest is also examined.},

	shorttitle = {What is the plausibility of probability?},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07373},
	abstract = {We present and examine a result related to uncertainty reasoning, namely that a certain plausibility space of Cox's type can be uniquely embedded in a minimal ordered field. This, although a purely mathematical result, can be claimed to imply that every rational method to reason with uncertainty must be based on sets of extended probability distributions, where extended probability is standard probability extended with infinitesimals. This claim must be supported by some argumentation of non-mathematical type, however, since pure mathematics does not tell us anything about the world. We propose one such argumentation, and relate it to results from the literature of uncertainty and statistics. In an added retrospective section we discuss some developments in the area regarding countable additivity, partially ordered domains and robustness, and philosophical stances on the Cox/Jaynes approach since 2003. We also show that the most general partially ordered plausibility calculus embeddable in a ring can be represented as a set of extended probability distributions or, in algebraic terms, is a subdirect sum of ordered fields. In other words, the robust Bayesian approach is universal. This result is exemplified by relating Dempster-Shafer's evidence theory to robust Bayesian analysis.},

Cox does so through a functional derivation of probability theory as the unique extension of Boolean Algebra thereby establishing, for the first time, the legitimacy of probability theory as formalized by Laplace in the 18th century.Perhaps the most significant consequence of Cox's work is that probability represents a subjective degree of plausible belief relative to a particular system but is a theory that applies universally and objectively across any system making inferences based on an incomplete state of knowledge. Cox goes well beyond this amazing conceptual advancement, however, and begins to formulate a theory of logical questions through his consideration of systems of assertions—a theory that he more fully developed some years later. Although Cox's contributions to probability are acknowledged and have recently gained worldwide recognition, the significance of his work regarding logical questions is virtually unknown. The contributions of Richard Cox to logic and inductive reasoning may eventually be seen to be the most significant since Aristotle.},

The book opens with a critique of the well-known Bayesian theory of epistemic probability. It then proceeds to develop an alternative to the additive set functions and the rule of conditioning of the Bayesian theory: set functions that need only be what Choquet called "monotone of order of infinity." and Dempster's rule for combining such set functions. This rule, together with the idea of "weights of evidence," leads to both an extensive new theory and a better understanding of the Bayesian theory. The book concludes with a brief treatment of statistical inference and a discussion of the limitations of epistemic probability.

Inductive logic in computers is explained where the design of the machine and the accompanying software are considered. The text then explains the functional equations and the problems of arriving at a rational description through some mathematical preliminaries. Bayes' equation and rational inference as tools for adjusting probabilities when something new is encountered in earlier probability distributions are explained. The book presents as well a case study concerning the error made in following specifications of spark plugs. The author also explains the Bernoulli trials, where a probability that a better hypothesis than that already adopted may exist. The rational measure of uncertainty and the principle of maximum entropy with sample calculations are included in the text. After considering the probabilities, the decision theory is taken up where engineering design follows. Examples regarding transmitter and voltmeter designs are presented. The book ends by explaining probabilities of success and failure as applied to reliability engineering, that it is a state of knowledge rather than the state of a thing. The text can serve as a textbook for students in technology engineering and design, and as a useful reference for mathematicians, statisticians, and fabrication engineers.},

A new condition, separability, was found sufficient and necessary for rescalability of infinite models. We finally characterize the acceptable ways to handle uncertainty in infinite models based on Cox's assumptions. Certain closure properties must be assumed before all the axioms of ordered fields are satisfied. Once this is done, a proper plausibility model can be embedded in an ordered fields containing the reals, namely either standard probability (field of reals) for a real valued plausibility model, or extended probability (field of reals and infinitesimals) for an ordered plausibility model. The end result is that if our assumptions are accepted, all reasonable uncertainty management schemes must be based on sets of extended probability distributions and Bayes conditioning.},

The stress-strain behavior comprised elastic, yield, strain softening and strain hardening regions that were qualitatively in agreement with previous simulations and experimental results. The chain lengths, number of chains, strain rate and temperature dependence of the stress-strain behavior was investigated. The energy contributions from the united atom potential were calculated as a function of strain to help elucidate the inherent deformation mechanisms within the elastic, yield, and strain hardening regions. The results of examining the partitioning of energy show that the elastic and yield regions were mainly dominated by interchain non-bonded interactions whereas strain hardening regions were mainly dominated by intra-chain dihedral motion of polyethylene. Additional results show how internal mechanisms associated with bond length, bond angle, dihedral distributions, change of free volume and chain entanglements evolve with increasing deformation. "

The study primarily focuses on methods for linear elliptic boundary value problems. However, error estimation for unsymmetrical systems, nonlinear problems, including the Navier-Stokes equations, and indefinite problems, such as represented by the Stokes problem are included. The main thrust is to obtain error estimators for the error measured in the energy norm, but techniques for other norms are also discussed. "

The quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (OMLE) converges to a well defined limit, and may or may not be consistent for particular parameters of interest. Standard tests (Wald, Lagrange Multiplier, or Likelihood Ratio) are invalid in the presence of misspecification, but more general statistics are given which allow inferences to be drawn robustly. The properties of the QMLE and the information matrix are exploited to yield several useful tests for model misspecification.},

  abstract   = {Cox's theorem provides a theoretical basis for using probability theory as a general logic of plausible inference. The theorem states that any system for plausible reasoning that satisfies certain qualitative requirements intended to ensure consistency with classical deductive logic and correspondence with commonsense reasoning is isomorphic to probability theory. However, the requirements used to obtain this result have been the subject of much debate. We review Cox's theorem, discussing its requirements, the intuition and reasoning behind these, and the most important objections, and finish with an abbreviated proof of the theorem.},
